##GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS--The 2016 Season in Review
#####An analysis of five key GSW players: Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant, and Klay Thompson.

The 2016-2017 season was marked by an impressive, and even record-breaking, performance by the Bay Area's Golden State Warriors. They dominated the Western conference through-and-through, with a staggering 81.7% win rate, and arose triumphant in the 4-1 finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

This was also the year that Draymond Green won best defensive player, Andre Iguodala was runner-up for best Sixth Man, and Kevin Durant was runner-up for the MVP title (but did end up taking home the MVP Finals title). Let's take a closer look at the numbers that defined this team's season through an analysis of the following players:

- Draymond Green
- Andre Iguodala
- Stephen Curry
- Kevin Durant
- Klay Thompson

There were some shocking statistics that came out of this year's games: anything from a relatively *low* shot percentage by King Curry, to the team's bright new start: Kevin Durant. It was his first season with Golden State Warriors, so we'll be paying special attention to his court action.

####Effective 2PT-Shooting Percentages
```{r echo = FALSE}
read.csv("../data/2pt_percent.csv")
```
*The table shows the five players, ranked by 2-pt effective shooting percentage*

####Effective 3PT-Shooting Percentages
```{r echo = FALSE}
read.csv("../data/3pt_percent.csv")
```
*The table shows the five players, ranked by 3-pt effective shooting percentage*

####Overall Effective Shooting Percentages
```{r echo = FALSE}
read.csv("../data/overall_percent.csv")
```
*The table shows the five players, ranked by overall (2-pt and 3-pt) effective shooting percentage*

These figures may initially appear somewhat off for anyone who has ever seen the Warriors play--Stephen Curry is renowned in the basketball world as a marksman. So why is Kevin Durant on top for the overall shooting percentage? Why is Stephen Curry ranked *so* relatively low? How does everyone else figure into these figures and the team?

####The answer to these questions may come from the following shot charts:

```{r out.width = '80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}

```

As you can see in the GSW Shot Charts for this past season, players are taking vastly different shots, based on their positions and pasts as players.

Let's start by looking at Stephen Curry: This past season, he broke numerous records, *ALL* for his three-pointers. He has become notorious for these shots off and on the court, and thus is often passed the ball in the three point zone. He has far more difficult shots than many of the other players, because of his assumed superior performance in that area. Curry is often the player that is implicitly asked to take shots from the farthest reaches of the court, or in the most intense parts of the game. Ironically, because he is known as a sharpshooter, this most likely accounts for his lowered effective shot percentage.

On the other hand, Andre Iguodala is a very strong small forward player, so he's not really supposed to be the one scoring. His stats likely appear so high, because he's only passed to ball to shoot when he's either *very* close, or in an ideal shooting position. These conditions are favorable to a high scoring percentage. Looking at the shot chart, it's clear that he's taking the fewest shots, and they're most of them are directly below the net.

One more slightly surprising statistic is Klay Thompson's performance. He's taken almost as many shots overall as Stephen Curry, but has a higher overall percentage. It becomes clear though, when you compare their shot charts, that Stephen Curry's 3-pt title is yet again chipping away at his actual percentage performance. Klay's 3-pointers are much more concentrated on the 3-point line, and thus easier shots to make. Curry, on the other hand, spread out vertically along the x = 0 line--all the way back to the center of the court. Klay Thompson is also shooting significantly more within the 2-point zone than Curry.

Those were some of the extremes, showing how percentages can be misleading when trying to figure out where and when players are most effective on the court. However, for the *almost* MVP Kevin Durant, his performance is as consistent on paper as it is on the court. This was a particularly good year for Durant, placing him on top of the overall field goal percentage table. His career field goal make rate is around 49.2%, but this 2016-17 season, he boasted about a 54.1%.

####Let's take an up close look at Kevin Durant's shot chart:

```

KD's shots are consistent: he is making about three-quarters of his shots within the key, about half on both the right and left shoulder, and slightly less than half the shots outside the 3-point line. For a first year, he's quickly acclimated to the team, court, and energy that the Bay Area crowd brings--especially for such a season. This is actually his *highest* shooting effectiveness of any season, including his career with the Oklahoma City Thunder.


There are a few **MAJOR** take-aways from this season:

- The Golden State Warriors have created an extremely potent team: each player, at least according to these stats, is playing their position--both the court situation, and actual position--to its fullest. The ball makes its way to the player most likely to make the shot: Curry in the 3-pt zone, KD all around, even small forward player Andre Iguodala in the key. Each player used to their max potential. 
- While the shot charts show off the point guards and power forwards, Draymond Green was instrumental in other ways. Their defense was as solid as their offense--and you know "a good defense is the best offense". Green became the first player in history to score less than 10 points while achieving a triple-double, attesting to the sportmanship of the team.
- Kevin Durant's success can be in part attributed to the team oriented playing and comradery that the Golden State Warrors offer. His best year was the year that he, Curry, Klay, and Green took on the Western Conference heroically and triumphantly. He was graciously accepted into the team, and for many for us at Goldenstategroupies.com, what feels like the beginning of a fammily.
